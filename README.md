## ðŸŽ¯ Research Overview
- **Research Question:** The growing popularity of indoor light energy harvesting for wireless sensor systems and low-power electronics has created a demand for systematic power estimation methods for different lighting conditions. Although existing research has recognized the critical role played by the spectral information on the output power of a photovoltaic cell, power estimation methods have rarely considered it. The vast majority of studies on the power estimation method in the past few years have focused on the conventional diode model, and even though scaling the parameters to other light conditions seems plausible, it is sometimes problematic to interpret the physical meanings of some parameters from theory. Therefore, a systematic investigation of the light condition characterization and PV cell modeling is fundamental to appropriately estimate the available light energy of an indoor environment. The power estimation method proposed in this thesis takes both spectral and intensity information into account and provides a data-driven approach to solve the scaling problem. We use low-cost sensors to measure spectral information and select an appropriate device model based on the classification of the light source. The evaluation results for both lab and real-world light conditions show that the proposed method achieves sufficient accuracy. This study provides new insights into the indoor light energy harvesting system design and makes a contribution to research on available energy estimation of the ambient environment.
